## About this book

Right from his days as a student, Kapil preferred to make notes for quick revision. Nowadays, he is making his notes in markdown. This book is mostly Kapil's notes made while learning Angular but updated a bit to be distributed as an EBook.

This book will be always work in progress. Once the training finishes, I will keep updating book updated with latest version and tips and tricks of Angular.
